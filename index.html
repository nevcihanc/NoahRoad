            It can be hard to decide what your next step in life should be. Old
            places to leave, new places to explore. What jobs are out there?
            What do companies look for? What skills do you need? Luckily, we
            know the way. We believe that your mind is your ticket to a career
            you like. And that ticket is valid for life.

          <h2>Reshape your talent into future skills.</h2>
          <p>
            Companies are looking for people with future skills. Like creative
            front-end development, data storytelling or creative learning
            development. Our work & learn tracks make you highly attractive to
            employers. Youâ€™ll invest in a range of skills that help you grow and
            continue growing - in your work and in your personal life. And you
            even get paid for it.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              ðŸ‘‰ LEARN TO WORK. WORK TO LEARN. <br />
              In some tracks youâ€™ll start with a base training, which - in some
              cases - you can do alongside your work or studies. This makes it
              easier to take the jump and at the end of it, youâ€™ll land on a
              solid foundation of skills.
            </li>
            <li>
              ðŸ‘‰ LOOK BACK TO STAY AHEAD. <br />
              During this period, we evaluate together. If this road turns out
              to not be for you, no worries. There are no fines or penalties. We
              think itâ€™s great you had the guts to try something new.
            </li>
            <li>
              ðŸ‘‰ ON THE ROAD TO DISCOVERY. <br />
              In the first period, youâ€™ll be working with a real team on real
              project assignments. Youâ€™ll be supported by instructors and
              graduates. This is your opportunity to discover if this track is
              something for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              ðŸ‘‰ TAKING THE HIGHWAY. <br />
              If you want to move forward, youâ€™ll start a paid traineeship at an
              organization. Youâ€™ll work 4 days a week and focus on learning for
              1 day. Personal coaching supports you in your new career.

                CREATIVE FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT -
                START MARCH 2020 <header>
                <p>If you like creating things, <a href="https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2018/what-is-a-FD.html">front-end development may be for you.</a> Itâ€™s easy to learn. Sureâ€”youâ€™ll have to put in the
                hours, but itâ€™s one of those skills that will give you immediate gratification: you see what you build.</p>
                
                <p>Itâ€™s also high in demand, low in supply. This means: a good salary, easy to land a job, and a quick road to a permanent
                position (if thatâ€™s what you desire). </p>
                
                <p>Front-end development is also highly flexible, which means you can arrange your work around the things that are
                important to you. </p>

              </header>
              <p>Do you enjoy creativity Ã¡nd technology? As a data storyteller you can do both: being creative by visualizing and
            technological by working with data. You will be the person that gives data driven recommendations to the business users
            in your organization.</p>
            <p>The paid traineeship will take 2 years, starting with 3 months of intense training.</p>

            Tableau, etc.)</p>

            can learn from it.</p>
            <p>In this track, you start immediately as a trainee working for a company. You are guided by senior learning strategists
            that will train you in the necessary hard skills and soft skills.</p>
